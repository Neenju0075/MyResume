Resume in Latex

### What is Latex?
   LaTeX is a document preparation system. When writing, the writer uses plain text as opposed to the formatted text found in WYSIWYG word processors like Microsoft Word, LibreOffice Writer and Apple Pages.

### why resume in Latex?
   A single-page, one-column resume developers. It uses the base latex templates and fonts to provide ease of use and installation when trying to update the resume. The different sections are clearly documented and custom commands are used to provide consistent formatting. The three main sections in the resume are  experience, education and projects.

### LaTeX Document Formatting and Creation:

Once you have prepared and saved a .tex file, it still must be compiled before it can be turned into a readable document. There are several ways this may be done:

 - Using the command line/terminal
 - Using a Graphical User Interface (GUI) LaTeX editor/compiler
